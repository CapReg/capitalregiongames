Hello and welcome to Albany Chess. 

### Contributing

Currently there is no online CMS so contributing will require knowledge of Github and MarkDown (or alternatively you can <a href="mailto:rbrittbusler92@gmail.com">email</a> me).

This site was born out of a desire to know where one could play Chess. The site I discovered July of this year (ENYCA) was taken down and [518Games](http://518games.com/) had not been updated since 2008. [518Games](http://518games.com/) though was so well curated and organized. I hope this site is half as organized as that one.

Ultimately, my goal is to get this place to a point where others may easily contribute to it and to a state where if I was to be bored with it I could hand the reigns to someone else who has an attention focus that's longer than 4 seconds. The major front facing part of this site is done so now I will go and try to see how to tackle more difficult parts.

### The Next Step 

(this is pretty rambly-as is the whole page I suppose.)

Over the next coming weeks, this site will probably see less dramatic changes. I hope to add some blog posts about time controlled tournament styled games vs non time controlled (this requires me to learn a bit about games I know not much about) and to also add more game places. More important than those goals though is to make sure this site is accessible. I am thinking about adding some kind of a demarcation noting if a game place is accessible by bus or not. I still need to do more work to make sure this follows WebAIM standardards and I've yet to test this on JAWS or Microsoft Narrator.

The site still needs a lot of work but at least it has some content ðŸ˜Š.
