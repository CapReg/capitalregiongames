Games are a barrel of fun (this is a *good* pun). This site is the offshoot sequal to the smash hit [518Games](http://518games.com/). Like its predecessor; its aim is to provide information for places to play games in the {% footnoteref "Capital Region"," Information should be social media agnostic (not hidden behind Facebook, Reddit and the like); this is partially why the creator of this site believes sites such as this are important" %}Capital Region{% endfootnoteref %}. Unlike its predecessor-the site creator enjoys making websites thus instead of being one of the {% footnoteref "ugliest","The original 518Games site, while not being the most flattering certainly is no where near the ugliness that is the original [Space Jam](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/) site." %}ugliest{% endfootnoteref %}. sites on the web, the creator hopes it is nice looking (but not *too* nice).

This site is still rather new and I hope to add a public admin feature (it will use Netlify CMS and contributors need not have knowledge of code or an account) so anyone may contribute to this site. Currently if you would like to assist with this site, you will need to have a [Github account](https://github.com/) and be familiar with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).
