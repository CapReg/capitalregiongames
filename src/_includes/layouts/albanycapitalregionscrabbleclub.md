The Albany Capital Region Scrabble Club is a [NASPA](http://www.scrabbleplayers.org/w/Welcome_to_NASPAWiki) club for players of all skill levels. It is unfortunately at this time not meeting, but the person who runs it hopes to be starting it up again sometime soon. They tend to meet at the New Covenant Presbyterian Church in Albany. They can currently be reached through [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/albanycapitalscrabbleclub/). They also have a [Tumblr site](https://albanyscrabble.tumblr.com/) although it doesn't appear to be as updated as their facebook.
