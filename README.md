- I am considering integrating Google Forms to allow others to more easily contribute to this site (who don't program)
- I am exploring other CMS (something besides Netlify). It needs to be collaborative and allow for multiple ways to log in (perhaps email)
- Content ideas so far
    - Posts on improving on OTB games
    - I'm thinking of only focusing on Chess and Scrabble unless I can have assistence managing the site. It's kind of a lot as a side project
    -  Thinking about interviewing people. People who run the game groups but might have to get a better mic and figure out how to transcribe audio files. **Need to look into this**
- I still want to find a local artist to create the images for this site. I'd prefer to avoid stock photos if possible for two reasons:
    1. Copyright. If my images are original it'll be less of a hassle
    2. Strengthen community. Support local business. 
_____________

### To do

* Add games that aren't chess
* Add centers to play games that aren't coffee shops
* Find a way to scrape data from various game sites to update this site automatically
* This site could probably be organized better
* Obtain permission to take photos of local game places so stock photos wll not be needed (will this strengthen community? Maybe).

> I am looking for assistence on the backend for this site - namely a way to filter posts by both location and game type (maybe that is not that important?) but also for others who would like in to aid in adding Game places until I can properly set up a CMS.
