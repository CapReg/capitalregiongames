This repository is the backbone of Capital Region Games, a site for those who enjoy playing games in the Capital Region.

All contributions are happily welcome! You can add a new game place by making a pull request. 

If you see an error or have any suggestions, please feel free to create an issue or email me at: rbrittbus@gmail.com. 

### To do

* Add games that aren't chess
* Add centers to play games that aren't coffee shops
* Find a way to scrape data from various game sites to update this site automatically
* This site could probably be organized better
* Obtain permission to take photos of local game places so stock photos wll not be needed (will this strengthen community? Maybe).

> I am looking for assistence on the backend for this site - namely a way to filter posts by both location and game type (maybe that is not that important?) but also for others who would like in to aid in adding Game places until I can properly set up a CMS.
