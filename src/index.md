The **Albany Area Chess Club** personally invites *you* to come play chess! We are a friendly chess club in the Capital Region located near the Albany airport. We offer a fun and affordable way to play chess with others. If you are as wonderful and as daring as we know you are, if you seek the kinds of adventures which can only be found amongst the 64 squares, if you have time to kill on a cold Wednesday evening-then you must come to the Albany Area Chess club!
