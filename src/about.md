We are the premier destination for playing chess in the Capital Region. Players here range from absolute beginners to masters. Some players enjoy playing fast 10 minute games while others prefer abstaining from the clock.  Here you will find players whose age hasn't crossed the double digits play against players over 50. Here you will find a place that will always welcome you to play chess.
