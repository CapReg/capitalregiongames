The creator of this site is indebted to [518Games](http://518games.com/) of which this site is inspired by, and [Andy Bell](https://hankchizljaw.com/) for his incredible [11ty course](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/). Without these, this site wouldn't exist as it currently does.
